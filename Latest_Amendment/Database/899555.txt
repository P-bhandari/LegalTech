Section 38V(3) in The Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act,   2006

 (3)  The State Government shall prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan including staff development and deployment plan for the proper management of each area referred to in sub- section (1), so as to ensure- (a)  protection of tiger reserve and providing site specific habitat inputs for a viable population of tigers, co- predators and prey animals without distorting the natural prey- predator ecological cycle in the habitat;  (b)  ecologically compatible land uses in the tiger reserves and areas linking one protected area or tiger reserve with another for addressing the livelihood concerns of local people, so as to provide dispersal habitats and corridor for spill over population of wild animals from the designated core areas of tiger reserves or from tiger breeding habitats within other protected areas;  (c)  the forestry operations of regular forest divisions and those adjoining tiger reserves are not incompatible with the needs of tiger conservation.
